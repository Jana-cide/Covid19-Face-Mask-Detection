# Covid19-Face-Mask-Detection
Computer vision Deep learning project.

Covid-19 pandemic paused our world for a while but people know how to cope up with situations like these.
The main motive for creating this project is because I wanted to create a product which would ensure that everyone remains safe.

It has a dataset can be used for face mask detection. I have divided it into 2 categories:

People wearing mask
People not wearing mask
